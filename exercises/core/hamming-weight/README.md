Hamming weight is the number of ones in the binary representation of a number.

Implement a public static getHammingWeight() method that counts and returns the Hamming weight. The method takes an integer as an argument.
```
App.getHammingWeight(0); // 0
App.getHammingWeight(4); // 1
App.getHammingWeight(101); // 4
